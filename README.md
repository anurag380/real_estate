# Real Estate
A real estate Django-React project would likely involve using the
 Django web framework to build the backend of a real estate website or application,
 and React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to build the frontend.
 The backend would handle tasks such as database management and API development,
 while the frontend would handle tasks such as displaying properties and handling user 
interactions. This type of project would likely be used to create a website or application
 where users can search for properties, view property listings, and contact real estate agents.
